Future Isabel 2050 ADCIRC model run: model simulation by considering future sea-level rise +0.2 m and increased storm wind speed (*1.1)

Storm surge event statistics calculation for each census block group
------------
GEOID: GEOID for each census block group
PeakSurge: peak flooding water depth (m) for inundated land areas (elevation >0 m mean sea level) within each census block group
MeanSurge: the average peak flooding water depth (m) for inundated land areas (elevation >0 m mean sea level) within each census block group
Frac: Inundated land area fraction (between 0-1; 1 for completely inundated for all land areas) during the simulated event within each census block group
